# Modulated time evolution (MTE) and Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)
This repository contains the code and data used for publication " Modulated time evolution for efficient variational ground-state preparation" ,
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.03251

This repository contains three main parts of python code
1. How to generate the Transvserse field Ising model Hamiltonian in the matrix representation. 
2. How to generate the locally adiabatic magnetifc field for the Transvserse field Ising model in the even-even spin and spatial parity subspace and then use it for time evolution. 
3. How to run optimzation for modulated time evolution.
4. How to run optimzation for the related Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA).
