# Modulated time evolution (MTE) and Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)
This repository contains the code and data used for publication " Modulated time evolution for efficient variational ground-state preparation" ,
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.03251

This repository contains three main parts of python code
1. How to generate the locally adiabatic magnetifc field for the Transvserse field Ising model in the even-even spin and spatial parity subspace.
   With details and description in the file generate_locally_adibatic_field.ipynb
   
2. How to run optimzation for modulated time evolution.
4. How to run optimzation for the related Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA).
