# Modulated-time-evolution (MTE)-and-QAOA
This repository contains the code and data used for publication " Modulated time evolution for efficient variational ground-state preparation" ,
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.03251

This repository contains three main parts of python code
1. How to generate the Transvserse field Ising model Hamiltonian in the matrix representation. 
2. How to generate locally adiabatic field in the Transvserse field Ising model in the even-even spin and spatial partyi subspace and use it for time evolution. 
3. How to run optimzation for Modulated-time-evolution.
4. How to run optimzation for the related Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA).
